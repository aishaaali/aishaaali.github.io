<h1><b>Is the Global Partnership for Education redundant? </b></h1>
<h3><i>Or is it a more progressive, democratic alternative to the World Bank? </i></h3>

<br />

<p>Suppose a rich country, say the UK, wants to give foreign aid to improve education in a poor country, say Malawi. How should it go about that? </p>

<p>There is an enormous literature comparing the cost-effectiveness of everything from buying free eyeglasses for students to paying performance bonuses to teachers. But who should make those choices, and who should manage the money? Who exactly should Her Majesty’s Treasury make the check out to? </p>

<p>Broadly speaking, there are three options, and right now, the UK employs all of them. </p>
<ol>
<li>The UK gives money to Malawi, aka “bilateral aid”.</li>
<li>The UK gives money to the World Bank, which makes concessional loans to Malawi. </li>
<li>The UK can contribute to the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), a pooled fund, which in turn gives most of its money to the World Bank to spend as grants in places like Malawi. </li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone involved is painfully aware how redundant this looks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the British Prime Minister <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/news/uk-and-kenya-host-major-education-summit-2021">Boris Johnson</a> has recently called on donors to open their wallets for the GPE, which launched its new replenishment campaign last month, asking for at least <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/financing-2025/case-for-investment">$5 billion</a> for the period 2021-2025 — more than <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/funding/replenishment">double</a> the amount it raised the last time around for 2018-2020. </p>

<p>GPE’s unique selling point is its single-minded <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/document/file/2020-10-GPE-summary-case-for-investment-2.pdf">focus on basic education</a>, and its fairly streamlined, no-strings-attached approach to funding poor countries’ own education plans. But is GPE the best channel for education aid? Donors have lots of options, and the prima facie case against GPE can seem compelling at times. </p>


<br />
      
<h3>The convoluted path from aid donors to aid recipients in the education sector</h3>

<p>Between 2016 and 2018, about <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=crs1">$9.45 billion</a> per year in foreign aid was earmarked for education. These funds often follow a convoluted path from their point of origin to the ultimate recipient, sometimes changing hands multiple times. </p>

<p><i>Source: Authors’ analysis of OECD’s Creditor Reporting System and <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/content/consolidated-financial-report-2019">GPE’s financial documents</a>, for the years 2016-18. "Bilateral agencies" include AFD, DFID, IDRC, and SIDA. "UN agencies" are UNESCO and UNICEF. "Non-profits" are Oxfam, Save the Children, and CARE. "Other countries" include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, and others. All numbers are expressed in millions of U.S. dollars.</i></p>


<p>We can put numbers on the three different paths from donor to recipient using data from the OECD’s Creditor Reporting System and GPE’s financial documents<a href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. We’ll focus here on sub-Saharan Africa, but you can click on the figure above to see numbers for other regions. </p>

<ul>
<li><b>One hop. </b> In the most direct channel, donors gave about $5.8 billion in direct bilateral aid for education programs to African governments between 2016 and 2018. Granted some of this bilateral aid goes through implementing agencies, in which case even the most direct route has two hops. </li>
<li><b>Two hops. </b> Donors contribute about $23 billion on an annualized basis to the World Bank’s International Development Agency (IDA), the bank’s fund for the poorest countries, which then makes concessional loans to developing countries. About 8 percent of that money goes to education projects, of which about 28 percent is spent in Africa. </li>
<li><b>Three hops. </b> In the least direct channel, donors also give money to pooled funds like GPE. Most of that money passes from GPE to the World Bank or UNICEF, and a large chunk of that then ends up funding education programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Some of the GPE money actually flows back to bilateral aid agencies, such as  the UK’s own Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office, to administer alongside the UK’s own bilateral aid programs. In total, GPE spent just under $1 billion in Africa from 2016 to 2018. </li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s zoom in and focus just on the flows that pass through GPE. </p>

<p><b>Figure 2. Is GPE redundant?</b> <br>A majority of GPE funds go to the World Bank, its main grant agent</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-sankey" data-src="visualisation/4297576"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p><i>Source: Data is from <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/content/consolidated-financial-report-2019">GPE’s cosolidated financial reports</a>, for the years 2016-18. All numbers are expressed in millions of U.S. dollars.</i></p>

<p>GPE accounts for about 7 percent of total aid for basic education, but relies on <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/2017-07-gpe-how-gpe-works-in-partner-countries.pdf">grant agents</a> to deliver its aid. GPE's largest grant agent is the World Bank, accounting for over <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/education/brief/the-global-partnership-for-education-and-the-world-bank-group-the-facts">75 percent</a> or $3.3 billion of GPE spending.</p>

<p><b>Figure 3. A leaky chain</b> <br>Overhead rates for the various agencies administering GPE grants</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4299797"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p><i>Source: Data is from <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/content/consolidated-financial-report-2019">GPE’s cosolidated financial reports</a>, for the years 2016-18.</i></p>

<p>For each new entity along the GPE funding chain, there are overhead costs, which help run programs but also add up. After funds reach GPE, which charges an average of 3 percent overhead each year for its secretariat costs, money then passes on to grant agents, who charge their own agency and supervision fees (both comprising <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/bod-2016-12-doc_12_-_delegation_of_authority_additional_supervision_allocations.pdf">overhead costs</a>). For example, UN agencies are one GPE grant agent and tend to charge 7 percent of the grant amount in agency fees, while the World Bank has a lower agency fee (1.75 percent). Of course, these fees help run programs, but what we don’t know is the value for money (or expertise delivered per dollar spent) for these widely varying overhead costs. However, the real question is this: if most GPE funds end up going to the World Bank, GPE’s main grant agent, why shouldn’t these funds be directed straight from the donors to the World Bank in the first place instead of passing through GPE?</p>


<p>There are a few possible reasons: geographic focus, sector focus, and governance.</p>


<br />
<h3>Geographically, GPE allocates more of its money to low-income and fragile countries compared to the World Bank</h3>

<p>We know that a large majority of GPE funds are disbursed by the World Bank, and we also know that all the GPE recipient countries (in 2016-2018) are IDA-eligible. This isn’t surprising considering poverty is one of the key determinants of <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/funding/applying-for-grants">eligibility</a> for GPE grants, along with fragility and population of out-of-school children. But does this overlap between GPE and the World Bank make GPE redundant?</p>

<p><b>Figure 4. Pro-poor bias</b> <br>GPE gives a larger share of its money to low-income economies</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4666108"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p><i>Source: CRS data on disbursements (USD) for 2016-18. GPE allocation data is from their <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/content/consolidated-financial-report-2019">financial reports</a>. World Bank <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups">income group classifications</a> are from 2019. Hover over the bars to see the disbursements as expressed in millions of U.S. dollars. </i></p>

<p>Given the big overlap in GPE and IDA countries, are both funds spending the education aid money on similar sub-groups of countries? Not quite. As shown in Figure 4, GPE spends a majority of its funds on low-income economies, including fragile and conflict-affected countries—a focus that has only increased over time since 2004. GPE uses a need-based allocation formula to determine allocation, with additional <a href="https://cerf.un.org/sites/default/files/resources/2017-08-gpe-case-for-investment2_0.pdf">weighting</a> for fragile and conflict-affected countries. IDA, in comparison, has a relatively smaller focus on low-income countries, and a much larger focus on “lower middle income” countries. Despite this differentiation in country focus, most GPE funds do end up flowing through the World Bank before going to the recipient countries.</p>


<br />
<h3>Sectorally, GPE spends a much larger proportion of its education funds on <u>primary</u> school compared to the World Bank</h3>

<p>More than the type of countries that receive GPE’s money, a bigger difference lies in sectoral prioritization. GPE spends a bulk (82 percent) of its budget on primary education. This is in contrast to IDA and UNICEF, who spend roughly one-third and one-fifth of their budget on primary education, respectively. </p>

<p><b>Figure 5. Primary focus</b> <br>GPE is much more focused on primary education compared to IDA and UNICEF</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4307463"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p><i>Source: CRS data on disbursements (USD) for 2016-18. “Early childhood education” is formal and non-formal preschool education. “Basic education” entails primary education, basic life skills for youth, primary education equivalent for adults, and school feeding. “Secondary education” covers both lower and upper secondary education as well as vocational training. “Post-secondary education” refers to higher education (universities, colleges, and scholarships) and advanced technical training. “Education (unspecified)” encompasses education sector policy planning, aid to education ministries, research, and teacher training where the education level is not specified. Hover over the bars to see the disbursements as expressed in millions of U.S. dollars.</i></p>

<p>We don’t know how these funds would be spent if GPE didn’t exist, or whether these funds would even exist within the larger aid architecture for education or go towards a different sector. What we do know is that GPE does mobilize commitments from donors that typically don’t have a big focus on basic education in their bilateral spending, such as France and Germany.</p>
      
<br />
<h3>GPE’s constituency-based governance gives rich countries relatively less control of the money compared to other funding bodies</h3>

<p>Perhaps the biggest difference between GPE and other funding bodies lies in its governance and decision-making structure. Figure 6 compares board member voting shares across GPE, IDA, and bilaterals such as the USAID and FCDO.</p>

<p><b>Figure 6. Shared governance</b> <br>The board representation of rich and poor countries across different aid channels</p>

<p><i>Source: <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/who-we-are/board">GPE board data</a> as noted on their website on September 1, 2020, <a href="http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/158691541106479537/IDAEDsVotingTable.pdf">IDA board data</a> as reported on August 17, 2020, and reflects voting powers of elected directors. Bilaterals refer to USAID and FCDO. <a href="https://undocs.org/e/icef/2020/2">UNICEF board data</a> is for 2020. For IDA and UNICEF, “Developing countries” include low-income and lower-middle income economies only, as classified by the <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519">World Bank</a>, while all others fall under “Rich countries.”</i></p>

<p>GPE is governed by a constituency-based board of directors, with <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/who-we-are/board">20 members</a>, representing developing countries, civil society organizations (CSOs), multilateral agencies, donor countries, and private sector organizations. In IDA, on the other hand, each member’s voting share, and there are <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11361">173 members</a>, is largely determined by their financial contribution to the World Bank. The five largest donors (US, UK, China, France, and Germany) appoint 5 members on the <a href="http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/158691541106479537/IDAEDsVotingTable.pdf">25-member board</a>, while the remaining elected members represent all the remaining countries. The US, for example, holds <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11361">10.2 percent</a> of the IDA voting share, which gives it considerable sway over IDA decisions.</p>

<p>GPE has a relatively larger share of developing country representation compared to IDA, and prioritizes <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/sites/default/files/2018-04-gpe-global-governance-manual-updated.pdf">consensus-building</a> in its board decisions. If all efforts to build consensus fail, GPE uses majority voting, but the majority vote must include at least one vote in favor from each key constituency, including developing countries, donor countries, multilateral agencies, and CSOs (or private sector organizations/foundations), which perhaps offers a more democratic way to make decisions. Similarly, education sector plans are monitored and implemented by a collaborative country-level forum called a Local Education Group (LEG), whose activities are usually coordinated by an international organization, often a UN agency.</p>

<p>Multi-stakeholder governance has its downsides. The need for consensus on a board representing widely divergent interests can lead to gridlock. GPE’s share of total basic education aid to low-income and lower-middle-income countries fell to <a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000373844/PDF/373844eng.pdf.multi">6.7 percent</a> from 11.4 percent between 2014 and 2018—a fall that may potentially be explained by the abrupt slowdown in disbursements in 2018-2019 after a slowdown in grant approvals.  This slowdown was compounded by an average three-year lag between approval and disbursements. </p>

<p>Fights within the big tent of the GPE board have also led to paralysis on key thematic issues. Notably, GPE <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/690839">avoided</a>  a policy position on private schooling for several years, and held up country programs with private-sector involvement at the objection of civil society representatives, before finally reaching agreement on a new <a href="https://www.globalpartnership.org/content/private-sector-engagement-strategy-2019-2022">private sector strategy</a>  in 2019. </p>


<br />
<h3>Redundancy versus legitimacy</h3>

<p>Yes, GPE is a slightly expensive way to channel aid money. And yes, most GPE funds end up going to the World Bank, which raises questions about why this money shouldn’t be directed straight to the World Bank in the first place. </p>

<p>But GPE is different from the World Bank both in terms of who gets the money and what the money is spent on. It has a stronger focus on low-income countries, and a much larger focus on primary education. </p>

<p>Ultimately though, the positive case for replenishing GPE rests primarily on its shared governance model, with a stronger voice for developing countries and civil society, and less conditionality of the sort the World Bank imposes. </p>

    <hr>

    <p id="footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup> Data quality is an issue with OECD’s Creditor Reporting System. Disbursements from multilateral partnerships and funds, like GPE, are coded as bilateral disbursements to regional or unspecified recipients. These
        multilateral institutions are listed under "Reported Channel Name", which allows us to identify them (though there are often misspellings). In order to analyze disbursements by country income type, as seen in Figure 4, we had to identify,
        code, and remove GPE from our CRS dataset and replace these entries with yearly disbursement data from GPE's financial documents. The amounts removed from CRS roughly match the amounts added from GPE's financial documents.</p>
